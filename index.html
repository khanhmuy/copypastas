                        and I have to carry my massive penis over my shoulder so it doesn’t drag on the floor, I go to the bathroom and while sitting on the toilet I need to aim my penis in the urinal(they built a different urinal for me) because if I piss in the commod my penis will drop into the water(which is nasty). Every time I go to school I need to make sure I hide it properly so I wear large hoodies and utilize my penis as my belt. It takes me 2 hours to shower just so i can clean my penis properly, everytime I masturbate my cum releases from my penis the day after because the travel distance is so long. When I get an erection, the blood flow to my legs completely stops and I cannot stand or move. They almost cut my penis when I was born thinking it was my umbilical cord. Every girl I’ve had a chance to be with has been scared of me and ran away crying. This is the life of a fellow massive penis haver.

                    <p id="t1-p2">
                        Ok so I'm pretty new to this whole dating thing, theres this girl I really like in my math class and I wanted to be her boyfriend, theres these really cool guys in grade 9 and they have sex about five times a day, they say that girls love it when boys show them their penis.<br>
                        So in my next math class I stole a seat next to her and stared at her boobs, I became erection and pulled it out through the fly of my pants, as I was about to tap her on the shoulder so she could see my penis, this other girl that has no boobs and is ugly screamed "oh my god!", screaming and pointing at my penis.<br>
                        I stood up to tell her to shut up and go away, but my penis was still hanging out from my pants, all the class was looking at it, I didn't want them to see my penis because it meant I would have to have sex with everybody in the room. I tried to make things right by swooping over to the girl I like and bringing my penis up to her face close up, this made it clear that I wanted her to see my penis and not the rest of the class.<br>
                        She screamed and tried to stab me with a pen, but she missed and stuck it up my bum, it felt really good, and some weird clear goo shot out from my penis and hit her in the face, she ran out of the room crying and I got sent to the office.<br>
                        My penis was caught in my zipper, so I had to leave it hanging out there for a while longer, but then classes ended and everybody entered the hallway, everybody saw my penis, and I now have to have sex with the entire school.<br>
                        I don't understand what happen, why are ufly girls so nosy, and why did the girl I like run away? Is my penis very small, I do not understand. <br>

                        I just shit and cum.<br><br>

                        FAQ<br>
                        • What does this mean?<br>
                        The amount of shit (and cum) on my computer and floor has increased by one.<br>
                        • Why did you do this?<br>
                        There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be worthy of feces or ejaculation. These include, but are not limited to:<br>
                        ✔️ Being gay,<br>
                        ✔️ Dank copypasta bro, where'd you find it,<br>
                        ✔️ walter.<br>
                        • Am I going to shit and cum too?<br>
                        No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.<br>
                        • I don't believe my comment deserved being shit and cum at. Can you un-cum it?<br>
                        Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I put shit back into my butt. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no exception.<br>
                        • How can I prevent this from happening in the future?<br>
                        Accept the goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated in my mom's basement. I will continue to shit and cum until you improve your conduct. Remember: ejaculation is privilege, not a right.<br>

                <h2>My (24F) Boyfriend (27M) will not stop calling his cum "Greggnog" During Christmas time</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t1-p5">
                        First off: I am not joking. I wish I was joking.<br><br>

                        I've been with my wonderful boyfriend Greg for over 4 years now, and this Christmas will be our third spent together. He's so much fun to be around, handsome, charming, and our sex life is great. Except for one small problem.<br><br>

                        Every year now starting in December he starts referring to his cum as "Greggnog." When I first heard him say this, it was in the context of a joke, so I laughed, and then I forgot about it. A few days after this, we're exchanging some spicy texts before he gets home from work he says to me, in all seriousness, "I can't wait to pour Greggnog all over your face." I could not believe he just said that to me, but I didn't know what else to do at the time but go along with it.<br><br>

                        Fast forward to this December. This phrase re-enters his vocabulary at the same time every year. It makes me cringe beyond belief, but until this year he used it sparingly enough for me to just be able to laugh and say "shut the fuck up."<br><br>

                        I'm sure that 2020 has done at least some irreparable psychic damage to all people, but unfortunately, for my boyfriend, this has manifested in the form of him referring to his cum as "Greggnog" non-stop. This month he has been using the term almost exclusively, in all contexts, and it is driving me batshit insane. I sat him down to talk last week, and I asked him very clearly and directly to stop. At the time, he said he would, and it did slow down for a few days, but it is now days before Christmas and he's back at it again with no end in sight.<br><br>

                        He absolutely means the world to me, and I saw myself spending the rest of my life with him, but I have serious doubts now whether or not I can if every Christmas is going to be like this. So please, reddit, what do I do to make this stop for good?

                        That doesn't make any sense. Anal sex is anal sex, whether you're male, female, a labrador or a homosexual lobster. Why do people have to come up with cringe-worthy names for everything? Nobody is going to think this is a gay anal sex thing because it objectively isn't. You know what? What's your mum's name? Your mum's name is now my special name for deepthroating horses. How do you like that, buddy?

                <h2>TIFU by cumming into a coconut</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t1-p8">
                        Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.<br><br>

                        Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. <br><br>

                        I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. <br><br>

                        --------------------<br><br>

                        For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would "go away in the winter". <br><br>

                        About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.<br><br>

                        Worst mistake I have ever made.<br><br>

                        You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. <br><br>

                        I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. <br><br>

                        **Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**<br><br>

                        TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.<br><br>

                        People with a vagina: while peeing do you sometimes press on your clitoral hood and pretend you're one of those soda dispensers at fast food restaurants and your pee is lemonade?<br><br>

                        I sometimes pretend while I'm peeing that my body is dispensing lemonade from one of those soda machines where you press the buttons to get your drink.<br><br>

                        I know this is super specific but I have to know if I'm the only one  who made this weird mental connection. It's not sexual, just a joke (I wasn't sure what to tag it other than nsfw).<br><br>

                        Edit: I realize I didn't specify that I am a cis woman.<br><br>

                        Edit: wow there are some real transphobes here. To clarify because I will die on this hill: not all women have vaginas and not all people with a vagina are women. Trans people are valid.

                <h2>Vaporeon breeding</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t6-p9">
                        Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more

Soo yesterday she visited my home and now ik she's my cousin! What da fuck! Imma do incest?! And she's like 18 yrs old!

                        I fucked up<br><br>

                        Earlier today I was really horny, and I saw what I thought to be a blank dvd. I thought, DVDs have a tight hole, they might feel pretty good. So I put my soft pp into the hole of the DVD, and for a few seconds as I started getting harder, it felt pretty good, but then, once I was fully erect, it started being painful. My pp was stuck in the dvd, and I had to break it in half to get if out. It was then when I flipped the broken dvd over and realized that it was not a blank dvd, but a copy of the movie UP.<br><br>

                        Well guys, guess I fucked up.

                        What is padoru?<br><br>

                        Its origin comes from a scene of the game fate/extra where the character Nero sings a modified version of Jingle Bells. The word Padoru is an alliteration of the word Paddle, which is a onomatopeia of the sound the hooves of reindeers do while walking. After that, people started drawing other characters is the same style Nero was drawn in that scene and those are called "padorus".

                        Wowwwww, you meow like a cat! That means you are one, right? Shut the fuck up. If you really want to be put on a leash and treated like a domestic animal then that’s called a fetish, not “quirky” or “cute”. What part of you seriously thinks that any part of acting like a feline establishes a reputation of appreciation? Is it your lack of any defining aspect of personality that urges you to resort to shitty representations of cats to create an illusion of meaning in your worthless life? Wearing “cat ears” in the shape of headbands further notes the complete absence of human attribution to your false sense of personality, such as intelligence or charisma in any form or shape. Where do you think this mindset’s gonna lead you? You think you’re funny, random, quirky even? What makes you think that acting like a fucking cat will make a goddamn hyena laugh? I, personally, feel extremely sympathetic towards you as your only escape from the worthless thing you call your existence is to pretend to be an animal. But it’s not a worthy choice to assert this horrifying fact as a dominant trait, mainly because personality traits require an initial personality to lay their foundation on. You’re not worthy of anybody’s time, so go fuck off, “cat-girl”.

                <h2>Hakui Koyori gives the best blowjobs</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t2-p4">
                        Out of all of Hololive, it's almost undoubtedly true that Koyori would give the best blowjobs. Sure, some of the other holos might be easier. Once you had her convinced to do it, though, Koyori would be by far the most competent at it. Let's start with experience. We know that Koyori is straight. She's said on stream what her preferences with regards to men are. We know that Koyori has a good looking body, because she's slim, fashion-aware, and a practiced talker. Koyori is also pretty neurotypical for hololive, with references to going out shopping with friends as a regular activity. All of this points to a girl that would have gone down at least a few times in her life, but you have to remember that she literally worked at a pub while pursuing her dreams of being an idol. That's the sign of an outgoing girl that's at least been casually intimate as a matter of course. When it comes to sucking dick, she'd know what she's doing. Then there's enthusiasm. Koyori is a perfectionist at using her throat. She's a tryhard at talking, she does her reps with tongue-twisters, and even when it comes to casual activities like gaming and quizzes, she always gives it her all. There's no reason to think she'd give any less when it comes to pleasing her partner. She would be shameless about slurping on cock, and even continue when it got uncomfortable for her, all just to ensure that she does a good job. And finally, there's raw, natural talent. Koyori has amazing lung capacity and an agile tongue. Anyone that's heard her talking or even heard her cute little noises knows that she's an expert at making you happy with her mouth. In short, if you want the absolute best blowjob that you can find from Hololive, pick Koyori. There is no other holo that will drain your balls half as well as Koyori. And that's one reason why Koyori is my oshi

                    <p id="t2-p5">
                        I can no longer go on without anime girls. Every day I wake up to look at my computer and phone, both equipped with anime wallpapers. The stares from the beautiful anime girls kills me deep down inside knowing I will never be able to interact with them at all. Today I woke up and turned my computer on, to be met with Zero Two, and tears formed in my eyes. Her beautiful green seductive eyes looking deep into me, I KNOW she wants me, and I want her so badly too. I want to kill myself so badly to be released from this hell of a 3D world. This reality is just too cruel. Why did God give humans the ability to create such beautiful sources of otherworldly envy? If anime just didn't exist, I probably would have been a functioning normie, but my inner desire is so deeply rooted in wanting to have sex with anime girls that I don't think I can recover. I don't even get horny for real women any more. Every time I masturbate to 3D porn I feel a painful regret in my stomach, but masturbating to hentai is one of the only things keeping me going. I am saving up for when some revolutionary Virtual Reality comes out, so I can become a full-time NEET and interact with anime girls for the rest of my life. help me

                <h2>As a self-respecting white male, thank Japan for anime.</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t2-p6">
                        Japan deserves nothing except our eternal gratitude for creating anime. It is essentially the only media currently existing that has a transcendental value, or is brimming with subtle emotion. The aesthetic employed within it is so often taken from european culture, and there's so many stories that deal with european mythology or are inspired by white civilization. But even when an anime deals exclusively with japanese culture, the emotional resonance is there. Why? Because the root of both the japanese and whites is the same. What is this root? Is it something immaterial like a soul, a word of God that materialized and solidified in both our cultures and psyches? Or is it just the end result of racial purity? I don't know. But I do know that anime has provided a glimpse into that which both races and cultures dreamed off and desired for aeons.

                        Anime is the ONLY form of entertainment suitable for consumption if you are a self-respecting white male. And as time goes on we can see the divide between those who have taste and those who do not, and I'm glad we're having this divide. Anime is the high culture of the 20th and 21st century, something that is a genuine creative effort devoid of dubious ideologies. It is a piece of eternity given to us and expressed by us. It is OUR artform and OUR defiance to the filth of movies, actors, celebrities and the whole Western media apparatus. It eclipsed them completely. It rendered them obsolete.

                <h2>NTR sucks ass</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t2-p6">
                        Okay, this comment kinda has nothing to do with the post, but the hentai image made me think of, well, hentai, which made me think about how NTR is an absolutely terrible hentai category. It's almost as bad as Gore, in my opinion<br><br>

                        The whole premise of it is that there's this really good guy who has a beautiful girlfriend who cheats on him with someone who's usually an asshole, a scumbag, fucking hideous, two of these things, or all three at the same time. And it makes no logical sense whatsoever.<br><br>

                        First of all, the really kind and emotional guy walking in on a beautiful girl getting fucked by an ugly guy is completely nonsensical. Why would she actively choose to go for the ugly asshole? Cuz he has a big dick? Cuz she's an asshole too? It's both misogynistic and misandristic in that it portrays all women as assholes who prefer huge cocks over good-looking and kind fellas, and it portrays men that are emotional as weak and foolish while portraying the other men as ugly dickholes. Nobody wins here!<br><br>

                        Another thing I hate about it is that why would you ever want to feel sad or depressed while jerking off?! I can kinda get why you'd jerk it if you're depressed, even though it would actually make you MORE depressed after the brief euphoric boost, but to actively become sad when reading hentai? That's a whole nother level of cuckolding! You actively WANT your lover to cheat on you AND upset you in exchange for brief sexual satisfaction on your end? How much of a fucking loser are you? Even if your dick is small, even if you're terrible at sex, if she's unsatisfied then she should just LEAVE YOU! Cheating is never okay, even if the guy wants to be cheated on! That guy doesn't need to be cucked, he needs to seek therapy!<br><br>

                        As for the woman's side, for the women who like reading NTR, if you enjoy cheating on your boyfriend with some fucking hideous motherfucker, then perhaps we should recreate the fucking SCARLET LETTER and slap a sign on you for the rest of your life that reads "I AM A FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT WHO DOESN'T DESERVE RIGHTS!" Because THAT'S HOW YOU ARE! But that brings me to a whole OTHER genre of NTR: where the genders are reversed! When there's a beautiful and kind-hearted lady who's with a total Chad of a guy who cheats on him for some bitch! THAT'S EVEN LESS OKAY THAN THE ORIGINAL ONE! Treat women with respect you fucking loser! What, she doesn't have big enough tits for you? She doesn't actively want to have sex? THEN RESPECT HER WISHES AND MOVE ON! Cheating, from EITHER party, is wrong! Horribly wrong! And if you're a girl who likes getting cucked as well, then once again, WHAT. THE FUCK. IS WRONG. WITH YOU?!<br><br>

                        I really fucking despise NTR and everything it stands for. I swear, the entire NTR category is worse than when Disney hijacked Stan Lee's old Twitter account to promote an NFT of a character that nobody gave a shit about. It's worse than THAT! Sorry for making a long ass comment that barely has anything to do with the post, but I needed a place to rant about this bullshit.<br><br>

                        TL;DR: NTR fucking sucks ass. Read some wholesome shit. Get in a good mood. Drink some hot cocoa. It's Christmas, not Valentine's Day. Be happy.<br><br>

I don't miss a beat and reply with a smirk, "I use alpine, a distro that doesn't include the GNU coreutils, or any other GNU code. It's Linux, but it's not GNU+Linux."<br>
                        The smile quickly drops from the man's face. His body begins convulsing and he foams at the mouth as he drop to the floor with a sickly thud. As he writhes around he screams "I-IT WAS COMPILED WITH GCC! THAT MEANS IT'S STILL GNU!" Coolly, I reply "if windows was compiled with gcc, would that make it GNU?" I interrupt his response with "and work is being made on the kernel to make it more compiler-agnostic. Even if you were correct, you won't be for long."<br>
                        With a sickly wheeze, the last of the man's life is ejected from his body. he lies on the floor, cold and limp. I've womansplained him to death.<br>

                        I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as unc0ver, is in fact, just shit, or as I've recently taken to calling it, the worst thing to come out of pwns ass. His shit is not a jailbreak unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning bootstrap (made by a guy just trying to live his life without getting fucked by pwn) useful by the modified version of the cicuta_virosa exploit, Cydibruh, and Sus-stitute, comprising a full jailbreak as defined by Pwn20wnd’s micro cock.<br>
                        Many jailbreak users run a modified version of this hyena shit system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of whale cum which is widely used today is often called "holy i cant take this anymore”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically this shitty bootstrap, developed by some team of children.<br>
                        There really is an unc0ver, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. unc0ver is the jailbreak app: the program in the system that runs the exploit which allows for system modification. The jailbreaking app is an essential part of the jailbreak, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete jailbreak. this horse shit is normally used in combination with this horrible bootstrap, the whole system is basically Elucubratus with donkey piss added, or Elucubratus/unc0ver. All the so-called "unc0ver" distributions are really distributions of actual feces!<br>

                        I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Taurine, is in fact, Procursus/Taurine, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Procursus plus Taurine.

                <h2>GNU/Linux is no more</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t3-p4">
                        No, Richard, it's 'Linux', not 'GNU/Linux'. The most important contributions that the FSF made to Linux were the creation of the GPL and the GCC compiler. Those are fine and inspired products. GCC is a monumental achievement and has earned you, RMS, and the Free Software Foundation countless kudos and much appreciation. Following are some reasons for you to mull over, including some already answered in your FAQ. One guy, Linus Torvalds, used GCC to make his operating system (yes, Linux is an OS -- more on this later). He named it 'Linux' with a little help from his friends. Why doesn't he call it GNU/Linux? Because he wrote it, with more help from his friends, not you. You named your stuff, I named my stuff -- including the software I wrote using GCC -- and Linus named his stuff. The proper name is Linux because Linus Torvalds says so. Linus has spoken. Accept his authority. To do otherwise is to become a nag. You don't want to be known as a nag, do you? (An operating system) != (a distribution). Linux is an operating system. By my definition, an operating system is that software which provides and limits access to hardware resources on a computer. That definition applies whereever you see Linux in use. However, Linux is usually distributed with a collection of utilities and applications to make it easily configurable as a desktop system, a server, a development box, or a graphics workstation, or whatever the user needs. In such a configuration, we have a Linux (based) distribution. Therein lies your strongest argument for the unwieldy title 'GNU/Linux' (when said bundled software is largely from the FSF). Go bug the distribution makers on that one. Take your beef to Red Hat, Mandrake, and Slackware. At least there you have an argument. Linux alone is an operating system that can be used in various applications without any GNU software whatsoever. Embedded applications come to mind as an obvious example. Next, even if we limit the GNU/Linux title to the GNU-based Linux distributions, we run into another obvious problem. XFree86 may well be more important to a particular Linux installation than the sum of all the GNU contributions. More properly, shouldn't the distribution be called XFree86/Linux? Or, at a minimum, XFree86/GNU/Linux? Of course, it would be rather arbitrary to draw the line there when many other fine contributions go unlisted. Yes, I know you've heard this one before. Get used to it. You'll keep hearing it until you can cleanly counter it. You seem to like the lines-of-code metric. There are many lines of GNU code in a typical Linux distribution. You seem to suggest that (more LOC) == (more important). However, I submit to you that raw LOC numbers do not directly correlate with importance. I would suggest that clock cycles spent on code is a better metric. For example, if my system spends 90% of its time executing XFree86 code, XFree86 is probably the single most important collection of code on my system. Even if I loaded ten times as many lines of useless bloatware on my system and I never excuted that bloatware, it certainly isn't more important code than XFree86. Obviously, this metric isn't perfect either, but LOC really, really sucks. Please refrain from using it ever again in supporting any argument. Last, I'd like to point out that we Linux and GNU users shouldn't be fighting among ourselves over naming other people's software. But what the heck, I'm in a bad mood now. I think I'm feeling sufficiently obnoxious to make the point that GCC is so very famous and, yes, so very useful only because Linux was developed. In a show of proper respect and gratitude, shouldn't you and everyone refer to GCC as 'the Linux compiler'? Or at least, 'Linux GCC'? Seriously, where would your masterpiece be without Linux? Languishing with the HURD? If there is a moral buried in this rant, maybe it is this: Be grateful for your abilities and your incredible success and your considerable fame. Continue to use that success and fame for good, not evil. Also, be especially grateful for Linux' huge contribution to that success. You, RMS, the Free Software Foundation, and GNU software have reached their current high profiles largely on the back of Linux. You have changed the world. Now, go forth and don't be a nag.

                        I installed linux mint and it took me about 4 hours to figure out. Finally launched it and it looked like ass, looked like a stupid green version of windows that is also stupid and sucks. It was slow too. It doesn't even run epic games either so I can't play fortnite which is super stupid and it sucks. I don't even care if windows spies on me, wtf are they gonna do look at my camera? Go ahead I'm sexy as fuck i don't care. Have fun linux users with your stupid "secure" green windows. LOL. Makes sense, linux users want to hide their ugly faces so they use linux. Real men who are actually sexy don't use a SERVER OS... lol.. thats right is a server os. I watched the tech lead on youtube because he is super cool and also sexy and he said that. Anyways, I'm going to get back to my fortnite (keep in mind you can't even do that on linux). So have fun nerds, have fun hiding your ugly faces. LOL.

It'll start at the command-line, and we'll build the installation all the way up to a full desktop environment! The GNOME, Xfce, Plasma, and MATE desktop environments are all covered. In addition, you'll be shown how to add optional disk encryption for good measure.

You’re the kind of person who thinks that property theft (a seriously illegal offence) is a joke. I don’t even know why you took that screenshot, because you didn’t pay 1000 dollars for it. I did. The blockchain doesn’t lie. Even if you try to save it, it’s my property. You’re just angry that you couldn’t afford this priceless masterpiece. Even if you could, your fingers couldn’t even click fast enough to get one of the 10000 NFTs sold. You’re just mad you don’t own what I own.<br>
                        So, delete that screenshot, or I swear, you’ll be hearing from my lawyers.

                        The year is 2035, you enter your local 7/11 to buy yourself a g fuel before your shift in the local crypto mine. The android working the counter says they only accept doge coin. You pull out your phone, draw a stick man in less than five seconds on a yellow back ground and then sell it as an NFT. From the sell you make 6 doge coin, about 5 million dollars in old world money. You go to buy the drink only to find out that from the time you closed your phone to the time you talked to the cashier the coins had dropped in value to only 3 dollars per coin and you now owe at least 10 doge coin to the robot for the gamer fuel. You leave the store, frustrated, and drive off in your Tesla

                        I just downvoted your comment.<br><br>

                        FAQ<br>
                        • What does this mean?<br>
                        The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.<br>
                        • Why did you do this?<br>
                        There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:<br>
                        ✔️ Rudeness towards other Redditors,<br>
                        ✔️ Spreading incorrect information,<br>
                        ✔️ Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.<br>
                        • Am I banned from the Reddit?<br>
                        No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.<br>
                        • I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?<br>
                        Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.<br>
                        • How can I prevent this from happening in the future?<br>
                        Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.<br>

                <h2>The average life of a redditor</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t5-p2">
                        The redditor woke up one morning, ready to beat up some 9 year old Tik Tok fans.<br>
                        The Mountain Dew and cum stains all over his sheets caused a rather disgusting stench, but he became used to it<br>
                        Immediately, he got on reddit and went to his favourite subreddit, r/atheism, and started scrolling. He stopped at a post that read “a local church has been destroyed, killing hundreds of people” and burst out laughing. He went into the comments section and commented “this is so wholesome 100! We hate christians!” Then he accidentally clicked the refresh button and started a crusade against the world. After that he found himself on r/news, where a child recently hit 2 million followers streaming fortnite on  twitch. He commented his trademark line: “you know what that fortnite loving prick deserves to be shot as many times as he has followers” and refreshed the comment to see his karma rising slowly.<br><br>

                        Finally, the man got out of bed, but not without his 200 kilo body nearly breaking the bed frame. He scratched his neckbeard and thought “you know today i will go on an adventure!”. He started scrolling to every known subreddit and posted “dear reddit, today i will be going outside, wish me luck!”<br>
                        After 20 minutes of being outside he updated it to hold:<br>
                        Edit 1: wtf women are real? And they aren’t all nude anime figures?<br><br>

                        Edit 2: ok so I just saw an unattractive woman, wtf<br><br>

                        Edit 3: so I got on a bus and felt a sneeze coming on, so I released it and the woman behind me had the audacity to say the line “bless you” luckily I had prepared for this and unleashed the fury of words that I built up using my extensive knowledge of the dictionary: “you better watch your mouth there, as I actually am an atheist. I don’t believe any god will bless me just by you saying it, and also why would an invisible sky daddy listen to you? I mean wtf you aren’t even pretty. God’s not real, and neither is your beauty”. For whatever reason, the woman got upset! Like what a f*cking snowflake! <br><br>

                        Edit 4: so I found a pretty girl who looked like she was from an anime, so I actually used like half of my daily energy for her! I legit held the door open for a solid 3 seconds! I tipped my fedora and asked for her number, and guess what she did? She legit just ignored my gesture and said “thanks” instead. She didn’t even ask me to show my magnum dong to her! Reddit, what do you think of this?<br><br>

                        After posting this, the man felt enraged at the cruel world. So he went back home decided he would unleash his anger on what he knew he could destroy: nestle and christianity. He instantly made a meme where he took an article about one of the employees being a Christian and added the reaction format “reddit assemble” to it. He posted it to dankmemes and it got 2k upvotes and a gold award! Instantly the guy went into the comments and posted “whoa, thanks for all the upvotes. And thanks especially to the kind stranger who gave me a gold! This is so wholesome!”. Someone replied to his comment with “r/redditmoment” and he got sent into a fit of rage. He u leashed his favourite copypasta, the navy seals one, and asked reddit “can we please downvote this karmawhoring idiot?”<br><br>

                        After what he felt what an accomplished day of making 2k karma that, he knew, was the currency of the future, he went and got a 6 pack of Mountain Dew and also his loyal katana so that nobody would play any non-pc decide around him. Then he played his rgb pc the rest of the night and got no sleep.

                        She's shocked at how I don't care and all I say is "Hands off my cock." just like how Falco kinda says it in Super Smash Bros.<br><br>

                        She wont respond to my texts.<br><br>

                        Update: She texted me back just saying "Are you gay or something?" And I responded with "Show me ya moves!"<br><br>

                        Now im blocked.

                        I love gura, a lot, like any chum should. And yeah her child like wonder is part of it. But she's a legal shark. Despite this any women I tell about gura calls me weird and thinks I'm a pedophile. I can't just not mention gura, as she's such a big part of my entertainment she's gonna have to come up. Genuinely what the fuck do I do? How do I explain this shit?

                        Backstory: I live round the corner from my gran and visit her often so thanks to me she has a vague grasp of what memes are and how they work. The other day when I was round at hers and she asked what memes were popular at the moment so I told her about the "OK boomer" meme. She knew what boomers were already so she was able to get the concept of this meme fairly easily.<br>
                        Fast forward to today, I'm over at my gran's again, and she's on the phone to my aunt. They got into a disagreement over a slightly racist comment my aunt made the other day (my gran is very much against racism) and my gran eventually just said "OK boomer" and hung up.<br>
                        I've never been so proud.

Taking showers and not wasting my precious time online, I have to move on from such simple things and branch out (you wouldn't undertsand).

                        "Based"? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is "Based"? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only word you can comprehend is "Based" - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, I'll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proof-read by several professors of literature. Don't believe me? I doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be "Based" once again. Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about five fucking letters? I bet you took the time to type those five letters too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing "send". You're so fucking pathetic. I'm honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? Absolutely nothing. I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a response. Do you want "Based" on your gravestone?

                <h2>Confession for a 15-year-old</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t6-p11">
                        All of this is out of the fucking blue, I know, I've been bottling up my feelings for the past month, I always bottle up my feelings, it's what I've done my entire life with any problems I've had, but I just fucking can't anymore.<br><br>

                        I've been in conflict between my mind and my brain for the past month, I can't fucking take it anymore, the only thing I can think to do is to write this<br><br>

                        Basically, I've fallen in love with you<br><br>

                        Yes, it's fucking weird, you're 15 for fucks sake, and you love callahan that's why I'm so fucking conflicted, my mind is telling me fucking no, it's illegal<br><br>

                        Every time I said "I love you" I meant it, I really did. Well not every time, the first few times it was friendly but after I kept and kept on saying it, and kept getting your response I was so happy and I fell in love with you. At first I thought you really loved me (romantically) but then I realised that you were more into callahan and that's when I got really fucking depressed and didn't eat for 6 days, couldn't sleep properly at all, and a bunch of other things<br><br>

                        I never thought love existed before I fell in love with you I always thought love was just simply "lust" or something, I always thought it was just something they would show in the media, I thought love was irrational, and was used to justify irrationality, I thought the concept of love was to just promote porn. I thought it didn't fucking exist. But now I get it, now I fucking get it. I don't know how to explain it, but I just fucking get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.<br><br>

                        For weeks, all day I have just been thinking about you literally every minute of the day, from when I wake up to when I sleep<br>
                        It's so odd, sometimes I wished that I never reinvited callahan back to my server but at the same time I'm so happy that you've found someone that you love, even if it's not me, because all I want right now is for you to be happy. I felt fucking terrible and felt disingenuous when I mentioned stuff about his past or whatever, I hated it and that's not usually me, other people in my server seem to dislike him too because of what I said and I hate myself because of it.<br><br>

                        Words, speech, drawings, or anything else I try to do will never capture my feelings<br><br>

                        I know it's fucking weird, you're too fucking young and my mind knows that, but my heart is fucking me over and I don't know what to do, I don't fucking know.<br><br>

                        I've never cared for some one so much in my life, like do I even love my family if I have feeling this strong?<br><br>

                        I wish you were older...<br><br>

                        I haven't even spoken to you, I haven't even seen you in real life, how did I even fucking fall in love<br><br>

                        I realise that I barely know you yet I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to get married, have kids, and die together. I want to help you with your drug problems, cutting problems, I want to rescue you from your home, and all other problems you have and I just improve your life overall and make you happy...<br><br>

                        I don't want to use you for sex or whatever then throw you away a couple months or years later, I want to spend my entire life with you, I want to get married I hate premarital sex because of this, there is no commitment, there is no liability, you can just throw them away at anytime, there is nothing to lose, yet it's so fucking prevalent right now. I hate it, I hate it so much, it's one of the things I hate most about this world, along with lies and drugs.<br>
                        Fuck I sound obsessed and needy as fuck, I realise that but I need to tell you all of this<br><br>

                        This past month has been crazy, I have never been so happy in my entire life than when I've been speaking to you, I always get butterflies in my stomach, my heart beats faster, I can't describe this feeling<br><br>

                        Whenever you mention callahan my heart feels broken and I go into immense "pain", I've never felt so miserable in my life<br><br>

                        Literally every single time I mentioned I'm in pain or not feeling too good, that's because my heart felt broken, I've never usually been too depressed in my life.<br><br>

                        You don't need to hold back with anything you ever say to me, I've never been suicidal thankfully and I don't think I will ever be. I've never ever had suicidal thoughts.<br><br>

                        These are only a small fraction of some of the feelings I've had<br><br>

                        I don't even know what I'm expecting from telling you this, you love callahan now, you love bladee<br><br>

                        I'm a fucking loser<br><br>

                        please don't make fun of me for this<br><br>

                        I hope I die soon<br><br>

                        It's raining right now, God is mocking me

                        Do you want "K" on your gravestone? Do you want people to remember you as the asshat who one day decided to respond to someone with a single letter? "Hey, look, everybody! It's that "K" guy!" That's who you are. You're going to be known as the "K" guy. How does it feel? Do you feel happy? Quite honestly, I don't care, which is why I'm not even going to respond to you. Good luck with your future as that guy who said "K". Do you really think you can just get away with "k" as a message? What if someone did that to you, huh? Do you think you would like it? Making an entire paragraph to get a fuckin' one letter response of the tenth letter in the alphabet, you think that's fuckin' funny, jackass? Do you want your crush to respond back with "k" after you spill your feelings out like this? (Take me back, Emma.) Huh? What if I did it to you? k. Did you fuckin' like that? What, did you just jizz in your pants because someone disregarded your entire effort of writing this ENTIRE paragraph FROM HAND in about fifteen minutes? That just makes me feel fucking rejected just like my ex. (Take me back, Roxanne.) k. What're you, fuckin' gay? Can I have a response that actually MEANS something instead of just shitfacing our "conversation" with the spam of "k?" Now occasionally with questions or something it's reasonable, but doing it to any fucking response they say. "We're having a nuclear crisis, you have fifteen minutes to evacuate." You're the type of person that would fuckin' say "k" to that, you limp dick hypocrite. You think you can get away with this, right? You think it's SOOOOOO funny to do this shit, but I can guarantee that you'll be taken out back and shot soon. Are those really the only words if we should even call them words that your miniscule brain can come up with? Even a fucking dyslexic can come up with a more intelligent and powerful response. Absolutely pathetic. You're a fucking disgrace to humanity and should be fucking shot down the moment you are seen. K?

                        Reasons teeth suck:<br><br>
                        
                        you have to brush them 2-3 times a day just to make sure they don’t rot in your mouth<br>
                        if you let plaque build up on your teeth and/or get gum disease, the bacteria has been found in arterial plaque meaning not brushing/flossing can lead to heart attacks<br>
                        for some reason, teeth are plaque magnets<br>
                        They’re entirely misleading because they look like bones but they aren’t bones mainly because they can’t fucking regenerate.

                <h2>I out-pizza'd the Hut</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t6-p14">
                        I finally did it. I out-pizza'd the Hut. It was the greatest mistake of my life. After years of perfecting my recipe, I made my way down to the local hut, fresh-baked pizza pie in hand. "Try this," I told the kid working the counter. He did, and he had to agree that it was better than anything Pizza Hut had to offer. Soon, the entire store, customers included, was feasting on my delicious pie. The manager walked over, grabbed a slice, and took a bite. I look at him, anticipation rising. This was the boss, the local fief lord of the Hut. His approval meant more to me than all the rest combined. He took a bite and nodded. "I'll be damned," he said, "you really did it. You out-pizza'd the Hut. Shame." Shame? What did he mean by tha- the manager pulled a gun out from behind his apron and shot the nearest customer in the head. "We have a Code Jalapeño," he said into his wrist as he executed the remaining customers. "I repeat, we have a Code Jalapeño." The ground was slick with blood. The kid working the counter choked out his dying breath as the manager turned to me. "You just had to do it motherfucker. You just had to out-pizza the Hut." He shoved the gun in my face. I was too scared to fight, too scared to run. The manager pulled the trigger. A click. The gun was empty. I threw a chair at the manager and scrambled out of the Pizza Hut, not even bothering to see if my missile hit its mark. I was closely pursued by the manager, who had gotten his hands on a deadly sharp pizza cutter. I suspected in his hands it would cut more than pizza. Somehow, I was able to get into my car and speed off, the manager cursing my existence as I left him behind. I took a deep breath. The manager was clearly psychotic. Yes, that was it, just a crazy man with a gun. It had to be. My phone rang. Sister. I picked it. "They're dead, she sobbed. They're all dead. M-mom, dad, Chris, Bill. Dead. They killed them all." I could barely understand her, so great were her sobs. "What do you mean? Where are you?" I asked urgently. "How is this possi-" a single gunshot sounded through my phone's speakers. Silence. Then, I heard a man's voice. "No one out-pizzas the Hut." He hung up. I drove down the empty county road, mind blank. I had nothing. They killed my family. I was alone. At that moment I knew what I had to do. They took everything from me. Well then, I would take everything from them. Pizza Hut was so terrified of being out-pizza'd, they forgot there's one thing worse than a man with a recipe: A man with nothing to lose. I'll give them a limited time offer they won't be able to refuse: two bullets for the price of one. With a free side order of pain.

                <h2>viperfan#7777's apology</h2>
                <div class="center">
                    <p id="t6-p16">
                        As I lay here in my bed recalling all that I've learned, I am thinking about all that you and I have experienced and been through together (good and bad) and my actions of the past. I am incredibly embarrassed and ashamed for all the bad that I've said and done, all the arguing and yelling, more importantly the embarrassment and unequivocal hurt and sadness I have caused you.<br><br>

                        It's so hard to think of the tremendous damage I have caused to break apart every good thing you were trying to build for us, for our future.<br><br>

                        I was feeling hurt and lost in our relationship, with the arguing and disagreeing and was feeling threatened by mention of Marlon and other worries on my mind. And not knowing exactly how to reach out to you and talk to you made me feel lost.<br><br>

                        Those are just my feelings and not excuses or blame. I take full responsibility for what I have done, and do truly want what is best for the entirety of you.<br><br>

                        You are right, I do have high emotions and where we were concerned I wasn't strong enough. My insecurities and inability to effectively manage how I was feeling at times has caused me to lose my best friend, my confidant, my partner and the woman whom I was surely going to marry.<br><br>

                        I wasn't there for you the way I should have been, the way you needed me to be there for you, for our relationship. You must have felt so alone and so sad and so hurt. I feel alone and sad and hurt now because of my own thoughtless actions.<br><br>

                        I have been focusing and working a lot on myself in that area. I have learned a great deal on how to manage and effectively communicate what I am feeling. I really want to thank you for helping me to identify that. There was a lot that I didn't realize and experience until you came into my life. You have helped me grow and learn so much.<br><br>

                        These are my words which probably don't mean a thing to you now, but I needed to let you know the truth about how I feel and the truth about what is and always has been. Every mean, deep cutting, cruel, hurtful, and horrid thing I ever said to you, I want you to know, need you to know, that those are not my true feelings.<br><br>

                        You are such a wonderful person. You are phenomenal, and magnificent and brilliant, you have effected me so profoundly. You must know that every mean thing I ever said was said out of pain, a lot of hard, deep, undiluted pain.<br><br>

                        You will say that I've said these things before but the difference now is that I've done it. I have corrected and changed the faults within myself that caused the rift between us and I am continuing to take advantage of the help that I've found.<br><br>

                        I didn't take these steps and make these changes because of some manipulative ploy or plot to get you back, because I have accepted the breakup, and have come to terms with it, and I understand why you chose to discontinue and why you feel the way you do towards me.<br><br>

                        I also understand why and how you could think I am manipulative, because I have made apologies before but I didn't hold long to the promises I made or the things I expressed in those apologies and I know that it seemed that when things were back to normal I would revert back to the actions and attitude I had before I apologized.<br><br>

                        I also want to add that any guy would be so lucky to have you, I was so lucky to have you, and I will continue my efforts in bettering myself as I am becoming a much better person. I can't thank you enough for all your efforts and all the care and attention you put into me and our relationship.<br><br>

                        I had felt lost and in the dark and didn't see that I had all that I needed in you to help me get through anything.<br><br>

                        And now, I want to say that I am sorry. I imagine that this means nothing to you anymore and no longer holds any weight but I feel a universe of remorse for all that I have said and done to cause you to feel the way you do. You have given me so much and shown me so much and I will forever be thankful for the profound effect you've had on me and in my life.<br><br>

                        I know I didn't show you the appreciation I should have, but I must inform you now, that although I said things and did things to the contrary, I did appreciate you, so much.<br><br>

                        I know there are no words that can make up for the sadness and pain that I've caused you and while I pray for your forgiveness I do not and cannot expect it. I am prepared and willing to accept that you will not forgive me. I just wanted you to know the truth about how I feel. I have learned to effectively use the experiences of the past to help with my efforts in making myself and my life better.<br><br>

                        I've thought about writing this for a long time. It was not easy in the least. I thought to myself "how in Gods name can I make peace with her after that last email that I sent her? How, in all Gods creation will she ever be able to move past that?" This is where that emotional counseling comes in.<br><br>

                        I was shown that we cannot allow our fears of rejection to discourage us from making a sincere and honest effort in trying to correct our mistakes of the past or make peace with people that we've hurt, we cannot allow that dread to prevent what could be a positive outcome. But instead to acknowledge and accept that rejection is a possibility and to utilize that as a deeper lesson as to the harm that our thoughtlessness and not being in control of our emotions can inflict on the ones we love as well as ourselves.<br><br>

                        This was one of the steps taught, to attempt to make peace with people in our past whom we've hurt or hurt us or had a misunderstanding or falling out with etc. And whether the result is positive or negative, whether they accept or reject our apology is up to them, and is ok because we at least tried and we can use that towards self betterment.<br><br>

                        No matter the reaction of the person or people we try to make peace with we can use it as a positive dose to our efforts.<br><br>

                        I have asked God to forgive me for hurting one of his angels. I know I will have to answer to him some day. I have made peace with myself and with God, now I want to make peace with you. Once more I want, need, to say, with every iota of sincerity and feeling and with every beat of my heart, I am sorry. I will take that to my grave and into the afterlife.

They are smooth, they are not confusing in how they work (looking at you vaginas) and they are good sources of pleasure. Sometimes, I just look at gay porn so I can admire the dicks.

                        "Gay Detector" Pro is a novelty app, not serious, just to have a good laugh; it has to be clear at the very start. The App allegedly can detect whether a person is: Gay- Bi- Straight- Undefined- Asexual- Super Macho- Ultra Woman- Screaming Queen. There are 8 options with a probability attached to it. This is very important to point: Each outcome has a probability attached to it; it means that there is always a possibility of an error, or that the statement is not true. Again, it's just fun to play with.<br><br>

                        To use the app:<br>
                        Initiate the app, press start, select the outcome, the next (if you want to change the outcome press back, selection must only be made on the screen 2, the one with green background). Ask the testee to speak for 10 seconds, result will come out after that.<br><br>

                        The person tested will speak for 10 seconds. The App will supposedly measure your voice to detect your sexual orientation.<br><br>

                        At the end 10 second recording, the app will send data (voice) for analysis.<br><br>

                        Examples of the outcome:<br>
                        There is a 90% probability that you are Straight.<br>
                        There is an 85% probability that you are Bisexual.<br>
                        There is 99% probability that you are a Super Macho.<br>
                        There is an 88% probability that you are Gay<br><br>

                        Does Gay Detector Pro work? Probably not, but it would a great fun to use<br><br>
